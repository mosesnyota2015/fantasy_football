# Fantasy Football App Prototype

This is an early prototype version of a Fantasy Football mobile application built with React Native and Expo.

## Current Features (Prototype)

The current prototype includes three main screens:

1. **Splash Screen**: A simple splash screen that displays when the app is launched, showing the app title and author.

2. **Player List Screen**: Displays a list of football players with their names and positions. This screen has a floating action button that allows navigation to the Add Player screen.

3. **Add Player Screen**: A form that allows adding new players by entering their name and selecting their position from a list of football positions.

## Future Development
I intend to add more features in the final copy of the app. 
I will improve the UI, add features to create team, have a way of setting player image
and handle data storage on the device.
